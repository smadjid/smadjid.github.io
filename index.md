## Short Bio

I am a computer scientist working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and Education (AIEd)**, with a focus on the design of intelligent, human-centered, and inclusive learning systems.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science. I am currently a researcher on the **ANR COOBRA project** at SICAL/LIRIS (CNRS UMR 5205), where my work examines multimodal interaction, accessibility, and collaborative practices involving visually impaired Braille users.

My research develops computational, interactional, and epistemic frameworks for AI-mediated learning — spanning adaptive systems, collaborative environments, and accessibility-driven design.
