## Short Bio

I am a computer scientist specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and education (AIEd). My work focuses on both the theoretical foundations and practical applications within this field. I hold a PhD and a Magister degree in Computer Science from [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/), complemented by an Engineer's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/).

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) within the [TWEAK](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/tweak) team. I contribute to the MOBILES project, which utilizes advanced analytics to understand and support the spatial practices of international students in France. In this role, I develop and apply AI-driven methods aimed at enhancing student integration and educational experiences.

Prior to my current position, I served as a research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in Brest, France. There, I contributed to the development of innovative analytical tools and models for digital learning practices. Previously, I was a full-time researcher at the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information (CERIST)](https://www.cerist.dz/), where my work centered on data organization, learning technologies, educational data analysis, and the application of artificial intelligence to digital education. My research seeks to effectively bridge AI capabilities with educational needs, developing technology to make learning more accessible, effective, and personalized.
