## Short Bio

I am a computer scientist specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and education (AIEd). My work addresses both theoretical foundations and practical applications in this field. I hold a PhD and a Magister degree in Computer Science from [University Abderrahmane Mira](http://univ-bejaia.dz/), and an Engineer's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Science and Technology USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/). Currently, I am a contract researcher at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/). Previously, I was a research engineer at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in Brest, France, where I contributed to developing analytical tools and models for digital learning practices. Before that, I was a full-time researcher at the [Algerian Research Center on Scientific and Technical Information (CERIST)](https://www.cerist.dz/).
